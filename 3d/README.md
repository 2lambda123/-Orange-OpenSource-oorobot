# OoBoBoT: 3D models

You can find in sub-directories 3D models to print to build your own robot.

## The simple way : print STL files

You can directly print the parts of the robot :
- *oorobot_wheel_v2.stl* : you need to print this part twice
- *oorobot_ball_support_v2.stl* : you need to print this part twice
- *oorobot_case_v2.stl* : you just have to print this part once

You can print this 5 pieces on a 20cm*20cm 3D printer. Personal printing parameters used :
- 0.2mm by layer
- 2 layers for shell
- 18% material fill

## The complex way : edit source

Models was built with BlockSCAD https://www.blockscad3d.com/editor/. So you can edit the models by uploading files stored un blockscad directory (use menu *Project->Load Blocks from your Computer*).

**Warning** : the *code* in *oorobot_case_v2.stl* was really big and not well organized ! Good luck if you want to edit it !
